1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv
 
2. Store raw data into hdfs location

hadoop fs -mkdir /sales_data 
hadoop fs  -put sales_order_data.csv /sales_data

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv 

create table sales_data
(
oder_no int,
quantity_ordered int,
price float,
order_line_no int,
sales int,
status string,
qtr_id int,
month_id int,
year_id int,
product_line string,
msrp int,
product_code varchar(20),
phone string,
city string,
state string,
postal_code int,
country string,
territory string,
contact_last_name string,
contact_first_name string,
deal_size string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count" = "1");


4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

load data inpath '/sales_data/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_data;


5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

create table sales_data_orc
(
oder_no int,
quantity_ordered int,
price float,
order_line_no int,
sales int,
status string,
qtr_id int,
month_id int,
year_id int,
product_line string,
msrp int,
product_code varchar(20),
phone string,
city string,
state string,
postal_code int,
country string,
territory string,
contact_last_name string,
contact_first_name string,
deal_size string
)
stored as orc;


6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

from sales_data insert overwrite table sales_data_orc select *;


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
select sum(sales), year_id from sales_data_orc group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
select max(quatity_ordered), product_line from sales_data_orc group by product_line;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
select qtr_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_data_orc group by qtr_id;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
select qtr_id, min(sales) as min_sales from sales_data_orc group by qtr_id;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum.
select min(sales) as min_sales, country  from sales_data_orc group by country order by min_sales asc;
select max(sales) as max_sales, country  from sales_data_orc group by country order by max_sales desc;

f. Calculate quarterly sales for each city.
select city, year_id, qtr_id, sum(sales) as quarterly_sales from sales_data_orc group by city, year_id, qtr_id;

h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold.
select year_id, month_id, max(quantity_ordered) as max_quantity from sales_data_orc group by year_id, month_id order by year_id, max_quantity desc;
